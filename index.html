    <h3 id="about">About</h3>
    <p id="aboutText">
      Born out of Los Angeles, 
      Crown Valley is a gritty fusion of rock and funk, 
      drawing inspiration from the raw energy of 
      classic rock legends and the infectious grooves of funk pioneers. 
      Since they began, they've brought raw energy and infectious grooves 
      to the stage. Harnessing the ability to switch from intense, riff-fueled
      jams to slower, melancholic melodies, they have captured the attention
      of their fans.
      With many electrifying performances under their belt, 
      they've become known for their blistering solos 
      and irresistible hooks. 
      Crown Valley is here to ignite stages and hearts 
      with their bare-bones, rock-funk sound.
